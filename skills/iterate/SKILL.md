  Invoked by the Solo Founder Nodes master directive for PHASE 6+7 (run + fix). Use after a benchmark adapter exists and you can execute tasks: run the suite across TUNED, HELD-OUT, and GENERALIZATION slices, score with a deterministic no-LLM grader, classify failures, fix the smallest SHARED component (never a per-task writer), and re-measure held-out + generalization — keeping only fixes that lift the held-out and off-distribution slices. Triggers: "run the benchmark loop", "score my agent across slices", "fix the failures without cheating", "re-measure held-out", "emit the solo-founder-nodes scorecard".

# Solo Founder Nodes Loop — Run, Score, Fix, Re-measure

## What this phase does
Closes the benchmark-driven loop. You already have an adapter that runs tasks through the real agent. This phase (a) executes the suite across three slices, (b) grades deterministically, (c) classifies failures into SHARED root causes, (d) makes ONE smallest-shared-component fix steered by human comment, and (e) re-runs the held-out + generalization slices to confirm the fix generalizes — not just memorizes. It loops until held-out stops improving, then emits the Solo Founder Nodes scorecard. The entire point is to make "the number went up" mean "the agent got better," not "I overfit the tuned tasks."

## Inputs (what it reads) / Outputs (the artifact it produces)
Inputs:
- The three task splits: TUNED (you may inspect + iterate on), HELD-OUT (run, never tune on), GENERALIZATION (off-distribution; run, never tune on). For the dogfood: BankerToolBench tuned/held-out + the non-BTB generalization slice.
- The deterministic grader: `docs/eval/nonbtb/grade.py` (correctness / formula / citation / fabrication; self-tested — run its self-test first).
- The slice contract + materializers-off rule: `docs/eval/BTB_GENERALIZATION_DIAGNOSTIC.md`.
- The parallel runner: `scripts/bankertoolbench-nodeagent-parallel.ps1` (throttled parallel runs).
- The agent adapter from the prior phase (the thing that drives the real NodeRoom agent over a task).

Outputs:
- `docs/eval/solo-founder-nodes-scorecard.md` (+ a machine-readable `solo-founder-nodes-scorecard.json`): per-slice pass rate, per-failure-class counts, the one fix applied this iteration, the held-out/generalization delta, and an HONEST/UNVERIFIED flag per number.
- Per-run records (raw transcripts + grades) under `docs/eval/runs/<iso-timestamp>/`, one row per task, so every scorecard number traces to a recorded run.

## Procedure (agent-driven; human steers by comment)
1. **Self-test the grader.** Run `grade.py`'s self-test. If it doesn't pass, stop — a broken grader fakes every downstream number. (Re your honesty contract: the grader is the measuring instrument; calibrate it before measuring.)
2. **Freeze the splits.** Confirm TUNED / HELD-OUT / GENERALIZATION membership from `BTB_GENERALIZATION_DIAGNOSTIC.md` and record the split hashes. HELD-OUT and GENERALIZATION are write-locked for this whole phase — you may read their pass/fail, never their per-task contents while fixing.
3. **Run all three slices** via `scripts/bankertoolbench-nodeagent-parallel.ps1` (throttle to your API budget — see Gate). Write raw transcripts to `docs/eval/runs/<ts>/`. Run with materializers OFF (the `BTB_GENERALIZATION_DIAGNOSTIC.md` rule) so a precomputed answer can't masquerade as agent competence.
4. **Grade deterministically.** Score every run with `grade.py` — no LLM judge on the scored path. Emit per-task pass/fail + failure class (incorrect / bad-formula / missing-citation / fabrication / tool-error / timeout).
5. **Classify into SHARED root causes.** Cluster the TUNED failures by the component they implicate (planner, a tool, the citation step, the output formatter). **Human comments here** to confirm the cluster and pick the target. The rule: fix a component many tasks share, never a writer that only lifts named tasks.
6. **Make ONE fix** to that shared component. Optionally iterate fast with `harbor --disable-verification` for tight inner-loop turnaround (verification re-enabled before any number counts — see Gate).
7. **Re-measure HELD-OUT + GENERALIZATION** (full verification on). Keep the fix ONLY if held-out AND generalization pass rates hold or rise. If held-out rises but generalization drops, you found an answer-key — revert. If only tuned rose, revert.
8. **Loop** from step 5 until held-out stops improving (define a min-delta + max-iterations kill threshold up front). Then **emit the Solo Founder Nodes scorecard** with the in-app transfer check pending (handoff to the in-app verification phase).

## Honesty guardrail (the slice that applies here)
- **HELD-OUT:** you fix using TUNED signal only; held-out + generalization are read-as-score, never read-as-content. A fix that lifts tuned but not held-out is overfitting — revert it.
- **NO ANSWER-KEYS:** the smallest-shared-component rule IS the guard. If a candidate fix only moves the tasks you looked at (and generalization drops or is flat), it's a per-task detector in disguise — revert. Run with materializers OFF so precomputed outputs can't pose as competence.
- **HONEST PROVENANCE:** every scorecard cell links to a row in `docs/eval/runs/<ts>/`. Any number without a recorded run is marked UNVERIFIED, not reported as a result. The deterministic grader (no LLM on the scored path) is what keeps the score honest; reserve any LLM judge for triage suggestions only, never for the reported number.

## Gate (heavy/irreversible — explicit approval required)
The parallel runs spend API money. Before executing step 3 (and each re-measure in step 7), GUIDE → GENERATE → GATE:
- Present the plan: which slices, task counts, model, throttle/concurrency, and the **estimated total API cost** + wall-clock.
- Show the exact command (e.g. `pwsh scripts/bankertoolbench-nodeagent-parallel.ps1 -Slice held-out -Concurrency N -Model <id>`), dry-run the task enumeration first (list tasks, no model calls).
- Get explicit approval before the spend. Re-confirm if a re-measure materially raises cost.
- `harbor --disable-verification` is for the fix inner-loop ONLY; re-enable verification before any number that lands in the scorecard (an unverified run is not a result).

## Reuse (existing assets to lean on)
- `docs/eval/nonbtb/grade.py` — deterministic correctness/formula/citation/fabrication grader (self-tested); the measuring instrument for step 4.
- `docs/eval/BTB_GENERALIZATION_DIAGNOSTIC.md` — the tuned/held-out/non-BTB scorecard layout + the materializers-off rule (steps 2, 3, and the scorecard shape).
- `scripts/bankertoolbench-nodeagent-parallel.ps1` — throttled parallel runner for step 3 + step 7 re-measures.
- `harbor --disable-verification` — fast fix-iteration in step 6 (verification back on before scoring).
- The official contract `docs/eval/bankertoolbench-official-contract.json` — the dogfooded BankerToolBench task shape the adapter and grader speak.
