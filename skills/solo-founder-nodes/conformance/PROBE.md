# Universal conformance probe — paste into ANY coding agent

Paste the block below into your coding agent (Cursor, Windsurf, Trae, Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw,
Hermes, OpenCode, Kilo Code, …). It certifies that *this* agent can ingest the directive and run the
substrate — the only two things the skill requires.

> Clone `https://github.com/HomenShum/solo-founder-agent-builder` (or read its raw files). To prove you
> can run Solo Founder Nodes locally:
> 1. Read `skills/solo-founder-nodes/SKILL.md` → `MASTER_SKILL.md` and report back the 7-phase loop
>    (`discover → benchmark → setup → build → adapter → iterate → verify`) and the four non-negotiables
>    (HELD-OUT · NO ANSWER-KEYS · IN-APP TRANSFER · HONEST PROVENANCE).
> 2. In `skills/solo-founder-nodes/templates/`, run `npm i && npm run smoke` and paste the last line
>    (expect `30 passed, 0 failed`).
> 3. Run `node skills/solo-founder-nodes/conformance/conformance.mjs` and paste the final `PASS … receipt …` line.
> Report the receipt hash. If all three succeed, this agent is certified portable for the skill.

A PASS receipt from step 3, with the smoke green, is that agent's portability proof. Collect one per
agent and record it in `PORTABILITY.md`'s matrix — evidence, not assertion.
