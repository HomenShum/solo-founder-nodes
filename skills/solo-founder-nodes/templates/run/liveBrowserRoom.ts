/**
 * liveBrowserRoom.ts — REFERENCE ADAPTER (shape only, sibling to spreadsheetbench.py)
 *
 * This file is the executable form of the 7-step Fresh-Room Live Browser Contract from
 * `nodes/6-verify.md`. It is NOT a runnable harness — it is the shape every per-app adapter
 * copies, the way `spreadsheetbench.py` is the shape every per-benchmark python adapter copies.
 * Each app writes its own concrete sibling (`liveBrowserRoom.spreadsheetbench.ts`,
 * `liveBrowserRoom.bankertoolbench.ts`, `liveBrowserRoom.noderoom.ts`, …) implementing these
 * signatures against its own substrate (Playwright + Convex + the app's real UI).
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * HONEST-LANE BOUNDARIES (read this before implementing)
 * ============================================================================================
 *   1. FRESH ROOM PER TASK. No room reuse across tasks. No pre-seeded artifacts. No prior memory.
 *      Quarantine boundary = a per-task room id with an empty work surface at t=0. If you cannot
 *      prove this from a Playwright trace, the row is `live_browser_room_passed = 0`.
 *
 *   2. NO HARNESS SHIMS. Every step drives the REAL user-facing path:
 *        - import = the real file picker / drop zone (NOT db.insert, NOT a fixture loader)
 *        - ask    = the real composer (NOT a direct call to the agent runtime)
 *        - export = the real export button (NOT a Convex row read, NOT in-memory bytes)
 *      Driving a hidden code path and calling it "in-app" is the cheat this contract catches.
 *
 *   3. NO PER-TASK CODE BRANCH. The substrate must NOT detect the task id and route to a
 *      special-cased import / prompt / export path. If `taskId === 'X' ? doX() : doGeneric()`
 *      appears anywhere in the adapter, the run is an answer-key, not capability.
 *
 *   4. DETERMINISTIC READINESS, NOT sleep(N). `waitForArtifact` must resolve on a DOM signal
 *      (testid present + Convex run id resolved) — never a wall-clock sleep. A sleep-poll
 *      hides Suspense/SSR blank-shell traps and silently passes failed runs.
 *
 *   5. OFFICIAL SCORER UNCHANGED. `gradeWithOfficial` must invoke the benchmark's own grader
 *      (SpreadsheetBench `evaluation.compare_workbooks`, the BankerToolBench official contract,
 *      etc.) on the EXPORTED bytes. No softening, no re-implementation, no "we use our own
 *      grader that's basically the same." If the official scorer is python, shell out to it.
 *
 *   6. DERIVE, DON'T ACCEPT. `writeLedgerRow` derives `live_browser_room_passed` from the six
 *      receipt booleans on `GateEvidenceUi`. A self-reported "I passed" field from the agent
 *      MUST NOT influence the gate — it is used (if present) only to detect disagreement and
 *      quarantine. This mirrors S9 in `references/honest-lane.md`.
 *
 *   7. ALL DELIVERABLE TYPES REQUIRED. If the benchmark spans multiple deliverable shapes
 *      (cell-level xlsx, sheet-level xlsx, chart, json, citation), each shape must produce at
 *      least one passing live-browser row before `allOfficialTasksLiveBrowserVerified` flips
 *      true. Partial coverage = `partial`, not `complete`.
 * ============================================================================================
