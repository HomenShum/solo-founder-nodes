# Autonomous benchmark runner — REFERENCE ADAPTER (shape only)

**This is not "what the skill does."** The skill is end-to-end for **your app**: it discovers what
your app does, then **picks or builds the right test for *that* app**. SpreadsheetBench is one
adapter — useful only if your app is spreadsheet-shaped. For any other app the agent should write a
sibling adapter (in-app real-task set, BankerToolBench, SWE-bench, your own held-out set, …) using
this file's *shape*.

What the shape is — the loop's **iterate/verify** phase as runnable code: clone the benchmark from
the autonomy allowlist → **seal a held-out slice** → attempt each held-out task with the **model in
the loop** → grade with the **benchmark's OWN grader** (or your own deterministic grader for an
in-app eval set) → write an **honest headline**. The harness contains no per-task answers; a row
counts only as a clean held-out probe. Mirrors `references/autonomy.md` + `references/honest-lane.md`.

## Reference adapter: SpreadsheetBench (`spreadsheetbench.py`)
Wraps the real benchmark faithfully — it imports SpreadsheetBench's official `evaluation.compare_workbooks`
(OJ-style: a task passes `hard` only if **all** its test cases match at `answer_position`). It does NOT
reimplement or soften the grader.

**Step 0 — install the Python deps (once, before any `--mode` invocation):**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # openpyxl + openai; see requirements.txt
```
Skip this and `spreadsheetbench.py` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: openpyxl` (or `openai`)
the moment a task is graded or `--mode api` runs. `sfn doctor` reports the Python lane status so
you find this before a run, not during one.

```bash
# full auto — a dev with a model key gets the whole run unattended:
OPENAI_API_KEY=...  python spreadsheetbench.py --slice 10 --mode api --salt "$SOLO_LEDGER_SALT"

# agent-in-the-loop — the coding agent IS the model (write attempts/<id>.json, then grade):
python spreadsheetbench.py --repo <clone> --slice 3 --mode agent --attempts-dir ./attempts --salt <s>

# inspect held-out tasks so an agent can attempt them:
python spreadsheetbench.py --repo <clone> --slice 3 --dump
```
It clones `RUCKBReasoning/SpreadsheetBench` (scope it via the policy `downloadAllowlist`), extracts the
dataset, seals the slice (HMAC), attempts, grades with the official grader, and prints
`HEADLINE … hard@all = <mean> over n=<n>` plus a `results.json`.

## Proven (this is a real run, not a claim)
A 2-task held-out demo (agent-in-the-loop, sample_data_200, official grader):
- `59196` (cell-level): **hard=1** (all 3 test cases) — genuinely solved.
- `99-24` (sheet-level): **hard=0** — honestly failed (value-fill can't reconstruct multi-sheet filters).
- **Headline: hard@all = 0.5, n=2.** Low n, honest number.

## Honest boundaries
- `--mode agent` value-fill handles **cell-level** tasks; **sheet-level** tasks need the code-exec
  attempt (model writes openpyxl code, run in the repo's `code_exec_docker`) — wire that as the
  api-mode `attempt` for full coverage. The grader is unchanged either way.
- The **referee stays out of the agent's reach**: the seal salt is the founder's/CI's
  (`SOLO_LEDGER_SALT`), and grading uses the benchmark's own code — the agent runs the loop but cannot
  forge the verdict. See `references/autonomy.md`.

## Add another benchmark
Copy this file's shape: `ensure_dataset` (clone from allowlist) · `seal_heldout` · `attempt` (api/agent)
· `grade` (call the benchmark's OWN grader) · honest headline. Same contract, any benchmark — that's how
every dev gets the same full-auto experience.

## Live-browser UI lane — `liveBrowserRoom.ts` (the second adapter shape)

The python adapter above proves the agent passes the **harness**. The TypeScript sibling
[`liveBrowserRoom.ts`](./liveBrowserRoom.ts) proves the agent passes the **live app** — the
in-app transfer non-negotiable from `nodes/7-verify.md`, made executable. A founder runs both
lanes; only the live-browser lane can flip a row's `live_browser_room_passed` ledger bit, and
only `clean && live_browser_room_passed` rows count toward the headline mean.

**Why a second adapter shape?** The python harness can be cheated by a code path that detects
the task id and emits a canned package — the score lights up while the live UI does something
else (or nothing at all, behind a Suspense/SSR blank shell). The live-browser lane drives the
real composer, the real upload button, the real export button, and feeds the EXPORTED bytes
into the benchmark's own official scorer. The two lanes have to agree, on the same task ids,
on the same answers, or the row is non-transferring.

**The 7 steps the adapter executes (per task, in order, with receipts):**
1. `ensureFreshRoom` — launch a brand-new room URL; empty work surface at t=0; one room per task.
2. `importHeldOut` — drive the real upload path with the sealed held-out task artifact.
3. `askAgent` — type the literal task prompt into the real composer (no template wrapper).
4. `waitForArtifact` — wait on a DOM testid + Convex run id (NEVER `sleep(N)` poll).
5. `exportArtifact` — click the real export button; read the bytes from the file the user gets.
6. `gradeWithOfficial` — invoke the benchmark's OWN official scorer on those bytes, unchanged.
7. `writeLedgerRow` — `SoloLedger.recordTask` with `live_browser_room_passed` DERIVED (not
   accepted) from the six receipts.

**Status: shape only.** `liveBrowserRoom.ts` ships signatures, receipt types, and the
honest-lane comment block — **not** a default implementation. Each app writes its own concrete
sibling (`liveBrowserRoom.spreadsheetbench.ts`, `liveBrowserRoom.bankertoolbench.ts`, …)
because the Playwright selectors, Convex schema, and export buttons differ per app, but the
contract is invariant.

**Coverage report.** Adapters also emit a [`../ledger/uiCoverage.ts`](../ledger/uiCoverage.ts)
record per track — `liveBrowserRoomCases`, `allOfficialTasksLiveBrowserVerified`, the
per-deliverable-type breakdown, and a top-level `strictUiCoverageReady` summary flag. **All
deliverable types are required**: if a benchmark spans `xlsx-cell`, `xlsx-sheet`, `chart`,
and `json`, every shape must have at least one passing live-browser row before
`allOfficialTasksLiveBrowserVerified` flips true.

**Dogfood reference.** NodeRoom is implementing this contract for its SpreadsheetBench +
BankerToolBench + multi-user-conflict tracks in `src/eval/officialBenchmarkUiCoverage.ts`
(sibling to `src/eval/officialBenchmarkTaskCoverage.ts`). That file is the worked example —
the skill stays portable, the noderoom file stays in the noderoom repo.
